                    <b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language.</em> which is what defines most web pages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    HTML is made up of the following...
                  <br>
                    Text content shows what you see.  
                  <br>
                    Markup shows what your page will look like.
                  <br>
                    References to other documents, such as images are possible.
                  <br>
                    Links to other web pages are possible too.

                  <b>HTML</b> uses tags in a certain structure to create a webpage, such as !doctype, head, title, body, etc.
                    <br>
                      <b>Tags</b> are what HTML uses  to mark text in a certain way.  
                    <br>
                      A tag normally has an opening tag, text, then a closing tag. 
                    <br>
                      Tags that do not contain content are called "void" tags.
                    <br>
                      I learned how to use <b>bold</b> and to provide emphasis via the <em>italics</em> tags.

                  <p>
                      Tags can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
                    <br>
                      Inline tags examples are break, bold, emphasis, void tags, new lines, etc.
                    <br>
                      Block tags create an invisible block around the content.  Examples of this is paragraph and div.

                          The <a href="http://www.udacity.com">anchor tag</a> creates links to other websites.
                            <br>
                          I can add images using the image tag and src attribute.

                    <b>1 - What a Web Page is</b>
                      <br>
                    A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
                      <br>
                    <b>2 - How Coding Works</b>
                      <br>
                    Coding happens when one writes text in a language that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
                     <br>
                   <b>3 - Computers are       Stupid</b>
                     <br>
                   Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax")
                     <br>
                   <b>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</b>
                     <br>
                   There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make test italic on HTML, you can always just look it up.
                     <br>
                   <b>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                   You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
                     <br>
                   <b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags, called "void" tags do not require a closing tag.
                    <br>
                  <b>Element:</b> A HTML element referes to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
                    <br>
                  <b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of a HTML element.

                    A Webpage uses structure, css, and java scripts. <b>Structure</b> is like the walls of your house that defines rooms.  <b>CSS</b> shows the style, much like paint or decorations in a room. <b>JS or Java Script</b> creates the interactive components, much like the remote control or a garage door opener in your house.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                    <b>Developer Tools</b> show the structure of a webpage.
                      <br>
                    <b>DOM - Document Object Model</b> is the tree like structure most commonly used today.
                      <br>
                    <b>Rectangles</b> are used to represent any element, even if it looks like something else.  These rectangles are used on an imaginary grid to account for the space on a page.

                    <b>Scratchpad</b>

                  <p>
                    <b>Inheritance</b> is the use of DOM to relay properties between ancestors and descendents.
                    Descendents can get text based properties, but not box-related properties.  
                    Inheritance cuts down on repitition, uses less CSS, faster web page loading, saves money on bandwidth and developmental costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b><em>Text based examples</em></b> are color, font, line spacing, line height, list style, text align, text indent, visibility, etc.

                  <p>
                    <b><em>Box based examples</em></b> are background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, outline, overflow, padding, position, etc.

                  <p>
                    <b>Selector</b> decides what style gets applied.  It is defined by a class name, along with attributes and values.
                  </p>  
                  <p>
                    <b>Box Model</b> consists of a margin, border, padding, and content.  
                    <em>Padding</em> can be adjusted by background.
                    <em>Border</em> can be adjusted by the color property.
                    <em>Margin</em> is the space between boxes.
                    <em>Width</em> consists of content + left and right border + left and right margin.

                    2. Look for repeated styles and elements.
